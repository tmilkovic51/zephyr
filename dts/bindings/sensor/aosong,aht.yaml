    Aosong AHT I2C Humidity and Temperature Sensor

    The Aosong AHT family of sensors provides temperature and humidity
    measurements through digital I2C interface. Designed as a replacement
    for the DHT family, the AHT family contains an improved MEMS semiconductor
    capacitive humidity sensor and a standard on-chip temperature sensor.

    AHT1x series does not support sharing the I2C bus with other devices,
    while AHT2x and AHT3x series do.
